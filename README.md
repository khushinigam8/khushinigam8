## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Khushi, a software developer based in India.

I am currently working as SDE-1 at Jio Platforms Ltd., where I build scalable backend systems and APIs for Jio Health Hub app.
I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and would love to contribute on high tech products as I grow in my career. I am also quite enthusiastic about Machine Learning and GenAI.
